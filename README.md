# strava-fun

This repo contains some python code that I used to play around with the api of social-fintess network [Strava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strava). The communication with the strava API is handeled by [strava-outh](https://github.com/sladkovm/strava-oauth). Which is a lightweight python server that implements [Strava Oauth Web Flow](http://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/).
